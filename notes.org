* Module ParseText

This module is intended to read short configuration files for Fortran 90 programs. It is based on a user-defined type =PTo=. Upon loading of a file, all lines starting by the comment character are cancelled out. Then, a series a type-specific routine allow the reading of variables. The line that is read will begin by the variable name and be immediately followed by the designated separator symbol (the equal sign by default).

If the given variable is not found in the file, the program stops.

* ideas for testing

idea: generate sample files to parse

read with templated fortran code. output only 'success' or 'error' on stdout.

data: dict of key/values

#+begin_src f90
  integer :: i

  i = PTread_i(PTo, 'i', default=3)

  n_errors = n_errors + check_equal(i, {i})

#+end_src

example template

#+begin_src f90
  program test
    use ParseText
    implicit none

    type(PTo) :: parser
    integer :: n_errors

    n_errors = 0

CONTENT

    if (n_errors > 0) then
       write(*,*) 'error count', n_errors
    else
       write(*,*) 'success)
    end if

  end program test
#+end_src
